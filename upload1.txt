I have requirements of MDM(master data management). I have 3 entities used in the MDM. There are 2 data sources from where we load the data to the entities of MDM. Before loading data to MDM, the data is converted to JSON format and the JSON is then loaded into MDM. Then the attribute mapping and data quality check is done inside the MDM. The 3 entities which are used are HCO(Health care organization), HCP (Health care profession) & CLINICAL STUDY. There are match and merge as well as survivorship rules which are considered to get a concrete Operation value(golden record). This golden record is then dumped into the snowflake database from where it can be used for further use. I want to create requirements and classify them as functional & non-functional.
